# QR-Code-Scanner-Using-Open-CV
Letâ€™s create a program that scans the QR codes and Barcodes from an image. For this program, we need three packages, which are OpenCV, NumPy, and pyzbar. Most of the python programmers are familiar with OpenCV and Numpy libraries. OpenCV is an open-source computer vision and machine learning library. It is a useful library for image processing. We are using this library in our project for processing each frame from a video captured by a device. We are using Numpy here because pyzbar works with OpenCV / numpy ndarrays. Whereas, pyzbar library is used to read barcodes and QR codes from a given image.
